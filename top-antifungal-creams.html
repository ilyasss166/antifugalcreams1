        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">That stubborn itch between your toes or the scaly patch on your arm won't go away? You're not alone. Fungal skin infections affect millions each year, but the right antifungal cream can make all the difference. After reviewing dozens of products and consulting dermatologists, we've compiled the most effective solutions for 2025—whether you're battling athlete's foot, ringworm, or yeast infections.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-4">How to Recognize a Fungal Infection</h2>
        
        <p>Before reaching for any cream, it's important to confirm you're dealing with a fungal issue. Look for these common symptoms:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>Red, scaly patches that may ooze or crust</li>
            <li>Intense itching, especially in warm, moist areas</li>
            <li>Circular rashes with raised edges (classic ringworm sign)</li>
            <li>Discolored nails that are thick or brittle</li>
            <li>Burning sensation between toes (athlete's foot)</li>
            <li>White, cottage cheese-like discharge in skin folds</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="italic text-gray-600">Note: If symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks of treatment or worsen, consult a healthcare professional as you may need prescription-strength medication.</p>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Lotrimin AF Antifungal Cream</h3>
            <p>This clotrimazole-based cream remains a dermatologist favorite for its broad-spectrum effectiveness against most common fungal strains. Users report noticeable improvement within 3-5 days, with complete clearance typically within 2 weeks. The non-greasy formula absorbs quickly, making it ideal for daytime use under clothing. <a href="https://amazon.com/lotrimin" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Check Price</a></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="product-card">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Lamisil AT Cream</h3>
            <p>Terbinafine works differently than azole antifungals, attacking the fungus's cell membrane. Clinical studies show it has slightly higher cure rates for athlete's foot (72% vs 62% for clotrimazole). The cream has a pleasant texture but may cause mild irritation in sensitive individuals. <a href="https://amazon.com/lamisil" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Check Price</a></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="product-card">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Tinactin Antifungal Cream</h3>
            <p>An excellent budget option that's been trusted for decades. Tolnaftate works particularly well when applied at the first sign of infection. Some users find it less effective for advanced cases, but its mild formula makes it great for children and sensitive skin. <a href="https://amazon.com/tinactin" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Check Price</a></p>

Many parents swear by it for diaper-area fungal issues. <a href="https://amazon.com/monistat" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Check Price</a></p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-12 mb-6">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">How long should I use antifungal cream?</p>
            <p>Continue treatment for 1-2 weeks after symptoms disappear to prevent recurrence. Most products recommend 4 weeks for nail fungus. Always follow package instructions or your doctor's advice.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">Can I use antifungal cream on my face?</p>
            <p>While generally safe, facial skin is more sensitive. Opt for creams labeled for sensitive skin (like Lotrimin Ultra) and avoid the eye area. If the rash persists or worsens, see a dermatologist as facial rashes often require precise diagnosis.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">What's better for fungal infections—cream or ointment?</p>
            <p>Creams absorb better for moist areas (between toes) while ointments protect dry, scaly patches. Powders work best for prevention in sweaty areas. Many find using a cream during the day and ointment at night provides optimal results.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mt-10">
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Pro Tip from Dermatologists</h3>
            <p>To maximize effectiveness, wash and dry the affected area thoroughly before application. Use a clean cotton swab to apply (don't use fingers) to prevent spreading the infection. Wash hands immediately after application.</p>
